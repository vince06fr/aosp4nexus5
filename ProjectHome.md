The "Android Open Source Project" AOSP provides the sources for the Android OS. There is also a very short documentation "Building for devices". But there are a lot of pitfalls which are hard to find.

The focus of this project is to document how to customize the AOSP source to get all things working.

An image for the Nexus 5 device is created from scratch and flashed to the device.

Then support for the Google-Play-Store is added to the image.

Finally a Java- and a C-source file are modified to log information into logcat.

Documentation is in the [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/aosp4nexus5/wiki/AOSPforNexus5)
